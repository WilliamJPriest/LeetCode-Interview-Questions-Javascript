                Leetcode 383 Hashmap https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/solutions/3360795/typescript-hashmap/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150
                
                See if the magazine contains the same letters as the RansomNote, magazine can have more letters than RnasomNote.

                hashmap example: {"l" => 1, "e"=> 1, "t"=> 3}
                1. creates a magzine hashmap
                2. adds every character in magazine to the hashmap by looping, if that letter already exists +1 else just set to 1
                3. checks every character in RansomNote, if the hashmap has the character -1 from the value, and keep doing it. 
                If you find a character that's not in the hashmap it's false otherwise true. You need to minus the value because you could have the letter twice

                side note: 
                magazineChars.set(char, magazineChars.get(char)! - 1) assets true in typescript

                map types: function canConstruct(ransomNote: string, magazine: string): boolean {
                const magazineChars: Map<string, number> = new Map<string, number>();
